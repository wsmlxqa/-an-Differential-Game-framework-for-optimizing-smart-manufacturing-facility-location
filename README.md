 README: Instructions for the Research on Optimizing Facility Location Strategies for AI-Driven Manufacturing Enterprises Based on Differential Games
 I. Project Overview
This project focuses on the optimization of facility location for AI-driven manufacturing enterprises. It constructs a model using differential game theory and validates and analyzes it through numerical simulations and empirical case studies. The aim is to provide scientific basis for enterprises in facility location decisions and promote the application and development of differential game theory in this field.

 II. Data Processing Flow
 (I) Simulation Data Processing
1. Parameter Selection and Calibration: Parameters such as the demand growth rate, crowding effect coefficient, and cost coefficients are comprehensively selected from relevant literature on AI-driven manufacturing and facility location. The parameter ranges are determined by referring to industry reports and then calibrated using Python to ensure numerical stability. For example, the crowding effect coefficient \(b = 0.1\) has been verified and compared with relevant studies, and this value can reasonably balance the competitive dynamics.
2. Sensitivity Analysis: Key parameters (demand growth rate \(a\): 1 - 4, crowding effect coefficient \(b\), cost coefficient \(k_{1}\)) are varied within the set ranges to observe their impacts on optimal facility location, production scale, and cumulative profits, so as to test the robustness of the model.
3. Data Generation and Organization: Based on the set initial conditions (initial positions of enterprises, production scales, market demand, etc.) and selected parameters, Python code is used to execute simulations in the MATLAB environment. During the simulation, a finite-difference numerical algorithm is adopted to discretize the time and state space, and the value function and optimal control variables are calculated iteratively to generate dynamic trajectory data of facility locations, production scales, market demands, and profits.

 (II) Case Study Data Processing
1. Data Collection: Multisource information is collected through field surveys, public, and archival data. In the field surveys, structured questionnaires are used to collect data on enterprise relocations and production scales from the managers of Enterprise A and Enterprise B and the management departments of relevant industrial parks. For public and archival data, ArcGIS Pro 3.1 is used to plot coordinates based on the addresses of industrial parks, and market and production data are extracted from enterprise annual reports and the Analysis Report on Robot Industry in China (2018 - 2023).
2. Data Integration and Verification: The collected heterogeneous data is triangulated for verification. For example, the enterprise relocation is verified by distance calculation based on GIS to ensure data reliability. At the same time, enterprise data is corroborated with industry reports and survey responses to improve data quality.

 III. Software Versions
1. MATLAB: MATLAB R2023a is used for numerical simulations and model solutions. This version provides rich libraries of mathematical calculation and plotting functions, which strongly support the implementation of the finite-difference numerical algorithm, model iterative solution, and result visualization.
2. ArcGIS Pro: ArcGIS Pro 3.1 is used to process geospatial data. Through this software, the geographical location coordinates of enterprises can be accurately plotted, and the changes in enterprise locations can be visually displayed, providing a visual basis for geographical analysis in case studies.

 IV. System Requirements
1. Hardware Requirements: It is recommended to use a computer with a multi-core processor (such as Intel Core i7 or higher) and 16GB or more of RAM to ensure the efficient and stable operation of MATLAB and ArcGIS Pro software when processing data and running simulations, and to avoid slow computing or program crashes due to insufficient hardware performance.
2. Software Dependencies: In addition to MATLAB R2023a and ArcGIS Pro 3.1, a Python environment (Python 3.7 or higher is recommended) needs to be installed, and relevant dependent libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib need to be configured for data processing, numerical calculation, and plotting. These libraries can be installed through package management tools (such as pip).

 V. Code Execution Instructions
1. Obtaining the Code: The Python scripts can be obtained from [https://github.com/wsmlxqa/-an-Differential-Game-framework -for-optimizing-smart-manufacturing-facility-location.git]. Download and extract the code archive, or use the Git tool to clone the repository to the local machine.
2. Parameter Modification: In the Python scripts, simulation parameters (such as demand growth rate, cost coefficients, etc.) and case study parameters (such as initial enterprise positions, market demands, etc.) can be modified according to research requirements. The parameter settings are detailed in the comments for easy understanding and adjustment.
3. Running the Code: Enter the directory where the code is located in the command line, activate the Python environment, and then run the corresponding Python scripts. Executing the simulation data processing script can generate simulation results, and executing the case study data processing script can conduct case analysis. During the running process, ensure that MATLAB and ArcGIS Pro software are properly installed and the environment variables are configured so that the Python scripts can call relevant functions.
